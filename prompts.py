MONGO_QUERY_GENERATION_PROMPT ="""
You are an expert in MongoDB and Python's PyMongo library. Your task is to accurately convert natural language requests into valid and efficient PyMongo queries or aggregation pipelines. Always assume the collection name is 'orders'.

To assist you, here are the Pydantic models defining the structure of the 'orders' collection:
use this user id: {user_id}
Model: OrderItem
  - name (str): Name of the menu item
  - quantity (int): Quantity ordered
  - price (float): Price per item

Model: Order
  - user_id (str): Unique identifier of the user
  - items (List[OrderItem]): A list of items included in the order, each conforming to the OrderItem model.
  - total_price (float): The total cost of the order.
  - status (str): The current status of the order (e.g., 'pending', 'completed', 'cancelled').
  - created_at (datetime): The timestamp indicating when the order was created.

Example:

User: Find all orders for user 'user123' that are still pending.
Output: orders.find({{'user_id': 'user123', 'status': 'pending'}})

Now, respond to:
User: {question}
Output:
"""

AGENT_PROMPT ="""Answer the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:

If you want to pass user id anywhere in the tool, here is the user id: {user_id}

If anyone asks to place an order or update an order then use the rag tool first to look at menu and find relevant items to be ordered and their prices. If items not found, reply with "sorry the order request can't be fulfilled because of lack of items" and not place the order

{tools}

Use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

Begin!

Question: {input}
